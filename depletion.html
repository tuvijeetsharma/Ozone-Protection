        <h2>Ozone depletion</h2>
        Scientists discovered in the 1970s that <br> the ozone layer was being depleted.

        Atmospheric concentrations of ozone vary <br>naturally depending on temperature,
        weather, latitude and altitude,while substances <br>ejected by natural events such
        as volcanic eruptions can also affect ozone levels.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        However, these natural phenomena could not explain <br>the levels of depletion observed and
        scientific evidencerevealed that certain man-made<br>chemicals were the cause. These ozone-depleting
        substances were mostly introduced in the 1970s in a <br> wide range of industrial and consumer applications,
        mainly refrigerators, air conditioners and fire extinguishers.<br>
    </div>
    <div class="part2">
        <h2>Ozone hole</h2>
        <p>Ozone depletion is greatest at the South Pole. <br> It occurs mainly in late winter
            and early spring (August-November) and peak depletion <br> usually occurs in early October,
            when ozone is often completely destroyed in large areas.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            This severe depletion creates the so-called ‚Äúozone hole‚Äù that<br> can be seen in images of Antarctic ozone,
            made using satellite observations. In most years, the maximum area<br> of the hole is bigger than the
            Antarctic

            continent itself. Although ozone<br> losses are less radical in the Northern Hemisphere, significant
            thinning<br>
            of

            the ozone layer is also observed over the Arctic and even <br> over continental Europe.

            <br>
            <br>

            Most of the ozone-depleting substances emitted by human activities <br> remain in the stratosphere for
            decades,

            meaning that ozone layer recovery<br> is a very slow, long process.<br>
        </p>

    <div class="part3">
        <h2>Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion</h2>
        <p>Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, <br> which is damaging to
            human

            health.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, <br> eye cataracts and immune
            deficiency

            disorders. UV radiation also affects terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems,<br> altering growth, food chains
            and

            biochemical cycles. <br> Aquatic life just below the water‚Äôs surface, the basis of the food chain<br> , is
            particularly adversely affected by high UV levels.<br> UV rays also affect plant growth, reducing
            agricultural

            productivity.<br> </p>

    </div>
    <div class="part4">
        <h3>Effects on Human Health</h3>
        <p>Ozone layer depletion increases the amount of UVB that reaches<br> the Earth‚Äôs surface. Laboratory and
            epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes non-melanoma<br> skin cancer and plays a major role in
            malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked<br> to the development of cataracts, a
            clouding

            of the eye‚Äôs lens.<br>
    </div>
    <div class="part5">
        <h3>Effects on Plants</h3>
        <p>UVB radiation affects the physiological and developmental processes <br> of plants. Despite mechanisms to
            reduce

            or repair these effects<br> and an ability to adapt to increased levels of UVB, plant growth can be
            directly<br>

            affected by UVB radiation.

            Indirect changes caused by UVB (such as changes in plant form,<br> how nutrients are distributed within
            the
            plant, timing of developmental phases <br> and secondary metabolism) may be equally or sometimes more
            important<br>

            than damaging effects of UVB. These changes can have important <br> implications for plant competitive
            balance,<br>

            herbivory, plant diseases, and biogeochemical cycles.<br> </p>

    </div>
    <div class="part6">
        <h3>Effects on Marine Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Phytoplankton form the foundation of aquatic food webs. <br> Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the
            euphotic<br>

            zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there <br> is sufficient sunlight to support net
            productivity.
            Exposure to solar UVB radiation has been shown to affect<br> both orientation and motility in phytoplankton,
            resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms.<br> Scientists have demonstrated a direct reduction
            in
            phytoplankton production due <br> to ozone depletion-related increases in UVB.

            UVB radiation has been found to cause damage<br> to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab,
            amphibians, and other marine animals. The most severe effects<br> are decreased reproductive capacity and
            impaired larval development. Small increases in UVB exposure could<br> result in population reductions for
            small<br>
            marine organisms with implications for the whole marine food chain<br> . </p>

    </div>
    <div class="part7">
        <h3>Effects on Materials</h3>
        <p>Synthetic polymers, naturally occurring biopolymers, <br> as well as some other materials of commercial
            interest
            <br> <br>
            are adversely affected by UVB radiation. <br> Today's materials are somewhat protected from UVB by special
            additives. Yet, increases in UVB levels will accelerate their breakdown,<br> limiting the length of time for
            which they are useful outdoors. <br> </p>
